# SpotifyDataDrivenPlaylists
SpotifyDataDrivenPlaylists is a straightforward data project that fetches data from the Spotify API, applies normalization and PCA using SciPy and sklearn, respectively, creates visualizations with Seaborn, and clusters songs into playlists. The entire process from data retrieval to playlist creation is documented and visualized in Jupyter notebooks.
